A small disclaimer: the main menu of this clone is entirely a joke. Mild Bomberman is not a real game, Mild Games is not a real company and Tha√≠s is just my first name.
The original game is called Super Bomberman, released in 1993 for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. It was published by Hudson Soft and licensed by Nintendo.
This clone was made entirely for study purposes and does not intend to override the credits of the original developers (to be added soon).
